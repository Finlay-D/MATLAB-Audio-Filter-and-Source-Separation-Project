This project was part of a module in the University of Strathclyde focused on signals and communications.
Two audio files were provided alongside a protected MATLAB script to combine them in a unique way for each student.

The assignment was to separate this combined audio file into the two individual voices by using the delay between 
the two stereo channels to estimate the distance of each voice from the hearer. Then filters were created and 
implemented to separate the speakers once more into two audio files.
